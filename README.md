On linux install the following modules using the terminal:
pi install anaconda
pip install chatterbot
pip install pyaudio
pip install webrtcvad
pip install DeepSpeech
pip install tensorflow

In some versions pulseaudio may be required.

After installing these copy all information in the text file named conversation.txt to a python IDE and hit play.
If there are dependencies required, install these using the terminal.
Else the program will run and the you can have a conversation with oshibot.

In order to train Oshibot with Oshiwambo supervised learning data for conversations, upload the conversations.yml dataset in the chatterbot training file.

If you wish to translate speech, then run the translation.txt file in a python IDE.
If there are dependencies required, install these using the terminal.
Else the program will run and the you can have oshibot translate something for you.

In order to train Oshibot for translations to Oshiwambo using supervised learning data, upload the englishProto.yml file in the chatterbot training file.

Future imporvements will include a GUI, an improved speach recognition system trained to the users voice by learning from recorded .wav files and user experience enhancements.
